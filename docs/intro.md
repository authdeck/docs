# Introduction

## What is Authdeck? 

> Authdeck provides a two-way solution to verify humanity without losing anonymity and staying decentralized.
Authdeck is a platform where you can prove your humanity by completing verification tracks which are mostly decentralized.
By doing this - you would increase your reputation score which, other dApps would use to prove your humanity.

## Verification Methods
- Captcha
- Social Verification
    - Twitter
    - Telegram (WIP)
- Q&A to prove your humanity (WIP)
- Blockchain History
- Vouching System (WIP)

You can find more details about each track in <u>[Tracks](./tracks)</u>

## Why Authdeck?
The current verification in dApps is using KYC which is a complicated process and is not decentralized.

We use a simple process by calculating reputation based on multiple factors to prove your humanity without exposing yourself.

> This is a win-win situation for both users and dApps as:

- Users don't need to upload their personal documents, and wait for those documents to be verified by a thirdparty system. 
- dApps don't need to implement KYC - which is very complicated process and condradicts the purpose of dApps. 

By using <strong>Authdeck</strong>: <br />

- Users just need to complete the verification tracks once. 
- Every dApp that's using Authdeck can call our API to verify the user without any hassle.
