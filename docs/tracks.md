# Tracks

## Captcha

The simplest of all, implemented for the sole reason of keeping bots away.

Solve captchas and get access to the rest of the site & some <u>reputation</u>!

**_Examples_**

Simple enough, right?

## Social Verification

- User signs nonce (message) using wallet
- Tweet out the signature tagging [`@authdeck`](https://twitter.com/authdeck)
- Give us the link and chill, we'll verify you if the signature matches ;)

## Q&A (WIP)

- Answer autogenerated MCQ questions only humans would be able to
- Since the questions are autogenerated and options are always shuffled, there's little to no way it can be automated by bots
- Get 70% or higher to get the score attached with this track

## Blockchain History

- We fetch all the data we can about the wallet and pass it through our grading algorithm to provide you with a score of all the metrics combined.
- You can read more about this track in: [trustQL docs](https://ayshptk.gitbook.io/pied-piper-docs/)

## Vouching System (WIP)

- Founders start by vouching 5 users, then those 5 users get vouching access, with which they can vouch another 5 users, and the chain continues!
- This track is the most valuable one, because if you get vouched, u don't need to complete other tracks - you are totally **verified**!
